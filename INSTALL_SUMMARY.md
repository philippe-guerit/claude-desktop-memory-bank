## Next Steps

The Claude Desktop Memory Bank is now fully installed and tested. You can:

1. Start the server manually with:
   ```bash
   python3 -m memory_bank_server
   ```

2. Configure Claude Desktop to use this MCP server using the configuration file
   provided in `config.json`.

3. Begin using the memory bank in your Claude Desktop conversations.

## Using the Memory Bank

To initialize the memory bank at the start of your conversations, use the new `memory-bank-start` tool:

```json
{
  "type": "tools/call",
  "tool": "memory-bank-start",
  "params": {}
}
```

This will:
- Automatically detect if you're in a repository
- Initialize memory banks as needed
- Load the appropriate custom instructions
- Select the best memory bank for your current context

For more advanced options, see the [tools documentation](doc/tools.md).
