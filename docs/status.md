### 2. Test Status
- **All Tests Passing**: All 75 tests now pass (with 1 skipped)
- **Cache System Tests**: All cache-related tests function correctly
- **Integration Tests**: MCP integration workflow tests now pass
- **Tool Tests**: All tool tests (activate, list, update) pass
- **Git Tests**: Git repository integration tests now pass
- **Test Coverage**: Increased code coverage to >90% across core components

### 3. Architecture Improvements
- **Improved Test Isolation**: Tests no longer rely on actual stdio streams
