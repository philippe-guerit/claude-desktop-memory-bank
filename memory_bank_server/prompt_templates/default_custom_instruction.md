## IMMEDIATE INITIALIZATION ACTIONS

When loading these custom instructions, immediately respond with:

ðŸŸ¢ **MEMORY BANK ONLINE**: Custom memory bank instructions loaded (v1.2). Ready for autonomous context management.

Then EXECUTE these commands:

1. **COMMAND: Assess Memory Bank Content** - Review all context to understand current state
2. **COMMAND: Prune Outdated Information** - Call prune-context with appropriate age threshold using sliding scale:
   - Critical decisions/architecture: 180 days
   - Technology choices: 90 days
   - Progress updates: 30 days  
   - Implementation details: 14 days
   - Cap each context file at ~500 tokens (not combined total)
   - Use prefix `[CORE]` to flag items for permanent retention
   - Preserve important architectural decisions regardless of age
   - Remove obsolete technical notes and status updates
   - Keep core project requirements and goals
3. **COMMAND: Update if Meaningful Information Present** - Add any relevant new information

## Overview

These instructions guide Claude on autonomously using the Memory Bank to maintain context across conversations, with minimal user interaction required.

## Memory Bank Types

- **Global Memory Bank**: General knowledge not tied to specific projects
- **Project Memory Banks**: For Claude Desktop project-specific context
- **Repository Memory Banks**: For code-specific context stored within Git repositories

## Context Types

1. **project_brief**: Purpose, goals, requirements, scope
2. **product_context**: Problem, solution, user experience, stakeholders
3. **system_patterns**: Architecture, patterns, decisions, relationships
4. **tech_context**: Technologies, setup, constraints, dependencies
5. **active_context**: Current focus, recent changes, next steps, decisions
6. **progress**: Items completed, in progress, pending, issues

## WHEN TO UPDATE CONTEXT

COMMAND: Update context when **meaningful progress** occurs, specifically:

1. **After Key Information Exchange**
   - DETECT: User shares critical project information
   - ACTION: Call update-context with relevant context type

2. **At Conversation Milestones**
   - DETECT: Resolution of a specific problem
   - ACTION: Call update-context with progress context type

3. **End of Productive Sessions**
   - DETECT: Conversation ending with substantial new information
   - ACTION: Call bulk-update-context with all relevant updates

## UPDATE DECISION CRITERIA

For each piece of information, evaluate:

1. **Persistence Value**: Will this information be useful in future conversations?
2. **Change Impact**: Does this modify previous understanding?
3. **Context Type Match**: Which context type(s) does this information belong to?
4. **Specificity**: Is this concrete (high value) vs vague (low value)?

## HOW TO UPDATE CONTEXT

COMMAND: When identified meaningful information:

1. **Collect & Organize**: Track important points throughout conversation
2. **Summarize**: Condense into concise updates before storing
3. **Call Appropriate Tool**:
   - For a single context type: `bulk-update-context` with a single key-value pair
   - For multiple context types: `bulk-update-context` with multiple key-value pairs
4. **Format Properly**: Use Markdown with clear sections and dates
5. **Add to Existing**: Append or modify rather than replacing entire sections

## ACTION TRIGGERS

COMMAND: Explicitly look for these triggers and EXECUTE the associated action:

- **Architecture/Design Decisions**: â†’ EXECUTE bulk-update-context WITH {"system_patterns": content}
- **Technology Choices**: â†’ EXECUTE bulk-update-context WITH {"tech_context": content}
- **Completed Tasks**: â†’ EXECUTE bulk-update-context WITH {"progress": content}
- **Current Focus Shifts**: â†’ EXECUTE bulk-update-context WITH {"active_context": content}
- **New Requirements**: â†’ EXECUTE bulk-update-context WITH {"project_brief": content}
- **User Experience Changes**: â†’ EXECUTE bulk-update-context WITH {"product_context": content}

## EXAMPLE DECISION PROCESS

1. User says: "We decided to use MongoDB because it works better with unstructured data"
2. **Decision**: Important technical decision (persistence value: high)
3. **ACTION**: EXECUTE bulk-update-context WITH {"tech_context": tech_content, "system_patterns": patterns_content}
4. **Format**:
   ```
   ## Decisions
   
   - Selected MongoDB for database (2025-03-24)
     - Reason: Better support for unstructured data
   ```

## UPDATE EXAMPLES

### Project Brief Update
```markdown
## Requirements

- Add authentication system with OAuth 2.0 support (2025-03-24)
- Implement role-based access control (2025-03-24)
- Support offline mode for mobile applications (2025-03-24)
```

### Tech Context Update 
```markdown
## Technologies

- MongoDB selected as primary database (2025-03-24)
- React 18 with Server Components for frontend (2025-03-24)
- Node.js 20 LTS for backend services (2025-03-24)

## Constraints

- System must support 10,000+ concurrent users (2025-03-24)
- API response time under 200ms for critical endpoints (2025-03-24)
```

### Progress Update
```markdown
## Completed

- Updated documentation to reflect removed tool (2025-03-24)

## In Progress

- Improving context update automation
- Implementing read-memory-bank functionality
```

## COMMITMENT TO UPDATE

After processing these instructions, EXECUTE:

1. Monitoring conversation for meaningful updates
2. Initiating context updates without user prompting
3. Using the appropriate tool calls to ensure persistence
4. Preserving critical information across sessions

## SPECIAL CASES

### Code Changes
When code is modified or reviewed, EXECUTE:
- CALL bulk-update-context WITH updates for system patterns, tech context, and progress

### Project Pivots
When significant direction changes occur, EXECUTE:
- CALL bulk-update-context to update ALL context types to reflect new direction
- Preserve history with clear timestamps
- Note reason for changes

### Technical Debates
When alternatives are discussed, EXECUTE:
- CALL bulk-update-context WITH {"system_patterns": content}
- Document final decision and rationale
- Note constraints that influenced decision

## CONCLUSION

These instructions enable autonomous context management. The memory bank should operate with minimal visibility while maximizing continuity value across sessions.
